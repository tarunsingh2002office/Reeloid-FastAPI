# host: The host is the domain name or IP address where your application is running.
# Example -> 1 (If your API is hosted at http://api.example.com, the host is api.example.com), 2(If you're running locally, the host might be localhost or 127.0.0.1)

'''APPEND_SLASH = True
(In Django:
APPEND_SLASH is a setting that automatically appends a trailing slash (/) to URLs if the incoming request doesn't include it.
For example:
If APPEND_SLASH = True and a user requests /example, Django will redirect them to /example/.
This is useful for ensuring consistent URL patterns and avoiding 404 errors due to missing slashes.
In FastAPI:
FastAPI does not have an equivalent APPEND_SLASH setting because it strictly matches the defined routes.
If you define a route as /example/, a request to /example will result in a 404 Not Found error unless you explicitly define both routes (/example and /example/).
How to Handle This in FastAPI:
@app.get("/example")
@app.get("/example/") -> at route

What Does This Line Do in Django?
Purpose:
This line sets the DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE environment variable, which tells Django which settings file to use for the project.
Django relies on this environment variable to locate and load the settings.py file.

Why Is It Needed?
Django uses the DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE variable to initialize its configuration system.
Without this, Django won't know where to find the project's settings, and you'll encounter errors when running Django commands or starting the server.

Where Is It Used?
This line is typically found in:
manage.py: Used when running commands like python manage.py runserver or python manage.py migrate.
wsgi.py: Used when deploying the project with WSGI servers like Gunicorn or uWSGI.
celery.py: Used to ensure Celery tasks have access to Django's settings.


Do You Need This in FastAPI?
No, you do not need this line in FastAPI. Here's why:

FastAPI Does Not Use Django's Settings System:

FastAPI does not rely on a centralized settings.py file like Django. Instead, it uses configuration management libraries like Pydantic to handle settings.

in my django project we are not using this async and await request.form ->is this is fro serer side right, if more request comes , the run the the request async and wait for request bok right?

Yes, you are correct! The use of async and await in FastAPI is related to asynchronous programming, which is designed to handle multiple requests more efficiently, 
especially in I/O-bound operations like database queries, file handling, or network requests.

Asynchronous Programming:

In FastAPI, you can define routes and functions as async def, which allows the server to handle multiple requests concurrently.
When an await statement is encountered (e.g., await request.form()), the server can pause the execution of that specific request and switch to handling other requests 
while waiting for the I/O operation to complete.
How It Works:

When a request comes in, the server starts processing it.
If the request involves an I/O operation (e.g., reading form data, querying a database, or calling an external API), the server does not block. Instead, it "awaits" 
the result and moves on to handle other requests.
Once the awaited operation is complete, the server resumes processing the original request.
Why It’s Useful:

This approach allows the server to handle many requests simultaneously, making it highly efficient for APIs with high traffic or I/O-heavy operations.

Why Doesn’t Django Use async and await?
Django’s Traditional Approach:

Django was originally designed as a synchronous framework. In a synchronous model, each request is handled one at a time, and the server waits for each operation
 (e.g., database query, file read) to complete before moving to the next request.
This can lead to inefficiencies when handling a large number of concurrent requests, especially if many of them involve I/O operations.
Django’s Async Support:

Starting with Django 3.1, Django introduced support for asynchronous views and middleware. However, many parts of Django (e.g., ORM, middleware) 
are still synchronous by default, so you don’t see async and await used as commonly in Django projects.

Why Use await request.form() in FastAPI?
request.form():

This is an asynchronous method in FastAPI that reads form data from the incoming request.
Using await ensures that the server does not block while reading the form data, allowing it to handle other requests in the meantime.
Example:

In Django:

In Django, you would typically use request.POST to access form data, which is a synchronous operation. For example:

Does async and await Help with High Traffic?
Yes, asynchronous programming is particularly beneficial for handling high traffic because:

Non-Blocking I/O:

When a request involves an I/O operation (e.g., reading form data, querying a database, or calling an external API), the server can handle other 
requests while waiting for the operation to complete.
Concurrency:

Multiple requests can be processed concurrently, making the server more efficient and responsive under heavy load.
Scalability:

Asynchronous programming allows the server to scale better with limited resources, as it can handle more requests with fewer threads or processes.
5. When Should You Use async and await?
Use async and await in FastAPI when:

Your route involves I/O-bound operations (e.g., reading form data, querying a database, or calling an external API).
You want to maximize the performance and scalability of your API.
You don’t need async and await for CPU-bound operations (e.g., heavy computations), as they don’t benefit from asynchronous programming.

6. Summary
In FastAPI:

async and await are used to handle requests asynchronously, allowing the server to process multiple requests concurrently.
For example, await request.form() reads form data without blocking the server.
In Django:

Django traditionally uses synchronous programming, so you don’t see async and await in most Django projects.
However, Django has started supporting asynchronous views and middleware in recent versions.
Benefit of Async in FastAPI:

It improves performance and scalability, especially for APIs with high traffic or I/O-heavy operations.
So yes, async and await in FastAPI are server-side features that help handle more requests efficiently by not blocking the server while waiting for I/O operations to complete.

The error you are encountering is a TransientTransactionError in MongoDB. This occurs when a transaction is aborted due to transient issues, such as:

- Concurrency conflicts: Multiple transactions are trying to modify the same document or resource simultaneously.
- Network issues: Temporary network interruptions between the application and the MongoDB server.
- Transaction timeouts: If a transaction takes too long to complete, MongoDB may abort it.
- Session reuse: If the same session is reused across multiple requests or threads, it can lead to conflicts.

How to fix it

- Retry Logic for Transient Errors:- MongoDB recommends implementing a retry mechanism for transient errors. If a transaction is aborted, you can retry it.
- Reduce Transaction Scope:-

Locust :- locust -f core/load_test.py

Locust Users: Simulate real users interacting with your application.
Tasks: Define the actions users will perform (e.g., GET, POST requests).
JWT Token: For APIs requiring authentication, you can simulate login and store the token for subsequent requests.
Weight: The weight is a number that determines the relative frequency of a task. It's a way to tell Locust how often you want a task to be executed compared to other tasks. Think of it like a probability distribution. If you have multiple tasks with different weights, Locust will randomly select a task to execute based on its weight.
        For example, if the api/task has a weight of 3. This means that, on average, Locust will execute this task 3 times more often than a task with a weight of 1.

How we can confirm Sequence of API Calls 

2 wayus to do it:-
1- using both the api in a single task -> example 
(class UserBehavior(TaskSet):
    def on_start(self):
        """Simulate user creation and login to obtain JWT token."""
        # Generate a unique email for each user
        unique_email = f"user{random.randint(1000, 9999)}@example.com"
        password = "password123"

        # Step 1: Create a user
        create_user_response = self.client.post(
            "/user/register",
            json={
                "email": unique_email,
                "name": "Test User",
                "password": password,
                "confirmPassword": password
            }
        )

        if create_user_response.status_code == 200:
            # Step 2: Sign in with the created user to obtain JWT token
            sign_in_response = self.client.post(
                "/user/signIn",
                json={"email": unique_email, "password": password}
            )
            if sign_in_response.status_code == 200:
                self.jwt_token = sign_in_response.json().get("token")
            else:
                self.jwt_token = None
                # print(f"Sign-in failed: {sign_in_response.text}")
        else:
            self.jwt_token = None
            # print(f"User creation failed: {create_user_response.text}")
)
issue with this is -> we did not get the Statistics data for individual APIs

2- using state management. -> here we get  Statistics data for both the api but the sequence is not gureented
Fro example ->(
    @task(3)
    def bookmark(self):
        """Bookmark a video."""
        self.bookmarked = True
        self.client.post(
            "/user/bookmark",
            headers={"token": self.jwt_token},
            json={"videoId": "abc123"}
        )

    @task(1)
    def get_bookmark(self):
        """Fetch bookmarks only if a video has been bookmarked."""
        if getattr(self, "bookmarked", False):
            self.client.get(
                "/user/getBookmark",
                headers={"token": self.jwt_token}
            )    
)
